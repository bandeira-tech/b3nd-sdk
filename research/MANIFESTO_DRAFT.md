# The B3ND Manifesto

**Version 0.1 (Draft for Community Review)**

---

## Preamble

We are building infrastructure for a world where people control their own data.

Not through policy promises that can be revoked. Not through terms of service that can be changed. Through technical architecture that makes unauthorized access impossible.

This manifesto defines what B3ND is, what it must remain, and what it must never become.

---

## Article I: User Sovereignty

**The user owns their data.**

1.1. Ownership means the technical ability to read, write, export, and delete one's data without requiring permission from any third party.

1.2. No B3ND implementation may create dependencies that prevent a user from exercising ownership rights.

1.3. Data addressable by a user's key belongs to that user. The protocol exists to serve users, not to extract value from them.

1.4. A user's decision to share, sell, or destroy their data is theirs alone. B3ND provides the mechanism; users provide the intent.

---

## Article II: Privacy by Architecture

**Privacy is not a feature. It is the foundation.**

2.1. Encryption shall be the default state, not an optional upgrade.

2.2. Systems built on B3ND must be designed such that unauthorized parties—including system operators—cannot access user data without user-provided keys.

2.3. Metadata minimization is a design requirement. Systems should collect and retain only what is necessary for function.

2.4. "Trust us" is not a privacy model. Technical guarantees must replace institutional promises.

---

## Article III: Open Protocol

**The protocol belongs to everyone and no one.**

3.1. The B3ND protocol specification is and shall remain freely available for anyone to implement, extend, or build upon.

3.2. No single entity—including the Foundation—may restrict implementation of the core protocol through patents, licenses, or other mechanisms.

3.3. Reference implementations shall be released under permissive open source licenses that allow commercial and non-commercial use.

3.4. The protocol evolves through transparent, community-driven processes. Changes are proposed publicly, debated openly, and decided by documented consensus mechanisms.

---

## Article IV: Portability

**Data must outlive any single provider.**

4.1. URI-based addressing ensures data can be identified independent of where it is stored.

4.2. Multiple implementations and providers must be able to interoperate. No single implementation may become required.

4.3. Users must be able to migrate their data between compliant providers without loss of functionality or accessibility.

4.4. Vendor lock-in contradicts the protocol's purpose. Any feature that creates artificial switching costs violates this principle.

---

## Article V: Transparency

**Hidden operations are hostile operations.**

5.1. Protocol development occurs in public. Proposals, debates, and decisions are documented and accessible.

5.2. Foundation governance, including financial operations, is transparent to the community.

5.3. Implementations should be auditable. Closed-source implementations are permitted but cannot claim B3ND certification without audit.

5.4. Changes that affect user privacy or data ownership require public notice and discussion periods.

---

## Article VI: Resistance to Capture

**The protocol must remain free.**

6.1. No single corporation, government, individual, or coalition may gain control over the protocol specification or its evolution.

6.2. The Foundation's governance structure includes safeguards against concentration of power, including term limits, conflict of interest policies, and distributed decision-making.

6.3. Funding sources must be diversified. Dependence on any single funder creates vulnerability to capture.

6.4. The protocol must be able to survive the disappearance of the Foundation, its founders, or any major contributor.

6.5. State-mandated backdoors, surveillance mechanisms, or key escrow systems are incompatible with this manifesto and shall not be implemented.

---

## Article VII: Neutrality

**The protocol serves users, not agendas.**

7.1. B3ND is infrastructure, not ideology. It provides capability without mandating its use.

7.2. The protocol does not discriminate based on the content of data, the identity of users, or the purpose of applications built upon it.

7.3. Legal compliance is the responsibility of implementers and users, not the protocol. B3ND provides tools; users and operators determine lawful use within their jurisdictions.

7.4. The Foundation takes no position on the political, commercial, or personal uses of the protocol, except where such uses would undermine the protocol itself.

---

## Article VIII: Sustainability

**The protocol must endure.**

8.1. Short-term growth shall not compromise long-term integrity.

8.2. The Foundation shall maintain financial reserves sufficient to operate through adverse conditions.

8.3. Governance shall include succession planning. The protocol's future cannot depend on any individual's continued involvement.

8.4. Breaking changes require careful consideration of deployed systems and sufficient transition periods.

---

## Article IX: Enforcement

**This manifesto constrains the Foundation.**

9.1. Foundation board decisions must be consistent with this manifesto. Inconsistent decisions may be challenged and reversed.

9.2. The Foundation may not accept funding, partnerships, or obligations that require manifesto violations.

9.3. Protocol changes that contradict this manifesto require manifesto amendment, not exception.

9.4. Manifesto amendments require supermajority approval through documented consensus processes, including public comment periods and community ratification.

---

## Article X: Amendments

**This document may evolve, but not easily.**

10.1. The manifesto may be amended to address unforeseen circumstances or clarify ambiguities.

10.2. Amendments require:
- Public proposal with rationale
- Minimum 90-day comment period
- Two-thirds approval of Technical Council
- Five-sevenths approval of Foundation Board
- Community ratification through documented process

10.3. Amendments may not contradict the core purpose: enabling users to own and control their data through technical means.

10.4. No amendment may authorize surveillance, mandatory key escrow, or removal of encryption capabilities.

## Commentary (Non-Normative)

### Why This Matters

The internet was built on open protocols. Email, the web, DNS—these succeeded because no one owned them. But the application layer became captured. Your email is open; your social graph is not. Your browser speaks HTTP; your data speaks proprietary API.

B3ND is an attempt to extend open protocol principles to the data layer. To make it technically difficult—not just legally prohibited—for platforms to lock in users.

This manifesto exists because technology alone is insufficient. Every open protocol faces capture pressure. Corporate acquisition, regulatory mandate, governance coup, developer burnout—many paths lead to closure.

The manifesto is a commitment device. It binds the Foundation to principles that survive individual judgment, temporary convenience, or external pressure. It creates accountability structures that make betrayal costly.

### What This Doesn't Guarantee

The manifesto cannot prevent:
- Malicious implementations that claim B3ND compatibility
- Government mandates that override technical protections
- Users choosing convenience over sovereignty
- Market failure of the protocol

It can only ensure that the Foundation and official implementations remain faithful to the original vision. The rest depends on the ecosystem, the community, and forces beyond any document's control.

### Inspirations

This manifesto draws from:
- The cypherpunk tradition of "privacy through technology"
- The open source movement's commitment to user freedom
- The Ethereum Foundation's attempt to steward a public good
- Lessons from protocols that were captured (and those that weren't)

We stand on the shoulders of those who built the open internet. We hope to pass something similarly open to those who come after.
