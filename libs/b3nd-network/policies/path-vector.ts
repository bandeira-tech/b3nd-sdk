/**
 * @module
 * `pathVector(peers)` — flood with signer-chain loop avoidance.
 *
 * Returns the same shape as `flood(peers)` but filters the outbound fan
 * per-peer: before sending a message to peer P, inspect
 * `data.auth[*].pubkey` on the message (the signer chain of an
 * `AuthenticatedMessage`-shaped payload); if P's id appears in that
 * chain, skip P — they have already seen (or signed) the message.
 *
 * Handles arbitrary-length cycles (A → B → C → A) without any state,
 * because the chain grows with every relay that re-signs. Works "for
 * free" when messages are signed with `Identity.sign()` + `message()`.
 *
 * ## Peer id convention
 *
 * For this to work, each `peer.id` must equal the peer's signing pubkey
 * (typically the hex-encoded Ed25519 key):
 *
 * ```ts
 * peer(client, { id: peerPubkeyHex })
 * ```
 *
 * Auto-assigned UUID ids never match any signer and the filter becomes
 * a no-op — pathVector then degenerates to plain `flood`.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * pathVector only *reads* the chain. It does not add the local
 * identity's signature on relay — that's the application's responsibility.
